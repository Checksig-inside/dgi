DGI is an R&D center of excellence about scarcity in the digital realm (Bitcoin and crypto assets) and the underlying blockchain technology.

Focused on consulting services, training programs, and software solutions, we are engaged in the scientific and academic debate, where the cypherpunk movement meets the Austrian school of economics. Cryptography, monetary theory, computer networking, and game theory: we explore all cornerstones and can assist in understanding them.

Of course, we write code and love to get our hands dirty in programming and technology.
