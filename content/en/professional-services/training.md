description: The training material includes slides, reference books, open-source code and software, and additional links and resources for deep-diving. This material remains always available, including its future updates and evolutions. A solid broad introduction comes first, accessible to people with any background, skill level, or learning ambition, gradually stepping up to more advanced tech/dev topics that require an increasingly good attitude for logical, mathematical, and computational thinking.

We offer training and education about Bitcoin, crypto-assets, blockchain, distributed ledger, smart contracts, and cryptography:
the program is based on the [Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology](http://www.ametrano.net/bbt) course taught at Milano-Bicocca and other universities.
The content can be customized depending on requirements: for corporate or academic settings, public or private events, as a short talk, a single day workshop, or a structured learning program over few days.
The training can be offered directly by us or through our Educational Program Partners, realized _on-site_ at your premises or at our own locations.
